# Seminar 2 SCAV 
#### Maria Bonal ✨

In this repository you can find the Seminar 2 of the subject _Sistemes de codificació d'àudio i vídeo_. For running this seminar we need the `BBB.mp4` video.

We need to run the script `main.py` which will ask which exercise do you want to run and then run it. First of all, run it in order (1, 2, 3 and 4) since some exercises need files from prior exercises.
Every function can be found in the class Seminar2.
